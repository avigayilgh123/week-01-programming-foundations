Day 2 – First Exposure to JavaScript

Right now, JavaScript feels confusing and abstract.
I can run code, but I don’t understand what the code is actually doing yet.

What surprised me:
- That small details like file names matter a lot
- That the computer does exactly what you tell it, nothing more
- That getting errors is normal and part of the process

What I learned today:
- How to run a JavaScript file
- That JavaScript is text that gets executed by Node.js
- That setup and tools are a big part of programming
